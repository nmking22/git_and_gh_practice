Travels

My favorite travel destination is New Orleans, though I can't limit it to just
one experience. I have been there three times, once as a teenager with my family,
and twice as an adult. I absolutely love everything about the city: the music,
the food, the history, the people, the "laissez les bon temps rouler" attitude.
Each visit has been totally different and equally exceptional, and I can't help
but feel like I am just scratching the surface of what the city has to offer.
I couldn't help but make my github & slack profile pictures a snapshot of
beignets at Cafe Dumonde, because of my love for this place!
