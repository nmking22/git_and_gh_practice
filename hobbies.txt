Hobbies

Playing Music - Since I was 8 years old, I have had a strong passion for music.
I began with the French Horn in the school band, which I followed through with
through high school in both the school band and local symphonic orchestras. When
I started high school, I joined the school's competitive marching band, and
learned the Mellophone, a brass instrument that is essentially the marching
version of the French Horn. Finally, in the middle of high school, I began playing
the guitar, and have never looked back. I absolutely love the instrument, and
particularly enjoy playing blues, and blues rock.

Board Games - I love the social aspects of board games as well as the mental
stimulation. They enable me to think in exciting and challenging ways while
building relationships.

Cooking - Coming from a family of cooks, both professional cooks and home cooks,
I've always had a passion for cooking (and eating!). I love food, but more importantly
love the way that food brings people together.
